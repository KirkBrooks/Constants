# Constants

This 4D database consists of a single class, `constants` and a demo method. With the class there are three lines of code required to create a constants XLF file.

I borrowed heavily from Cannon Smith's tech note: https://kb.4d.com/assetid=77806

This class allows you to create constants files for 4D databases from a method.
